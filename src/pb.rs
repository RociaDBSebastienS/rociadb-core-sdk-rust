//! Generated protobuf types and gRPC clients.
//!
//! This module is internal to the crate. It is regenerated from
//! `proto/upstream/v1/upstream.proto` by prost/tonic on every build, and a
//! routine prost or tonic upgrade can change field types, add fields, or
//! otherwise reshape these generated types without the SDK's own API
//! changing at all — which is why nothing outside the crate can name a type
//! here, and why the module is not part of the semver contract.
//!
//! The handful of generated types that genuinely are part of the public
//! contract — because they appear in a public method signature and callers
//! need to name them — are re-exported individually at the crate root
//! instead: [`crate::CollectionInfo`], [`crate::StatResponse`],
//! [`crate::Neighbor`], [`crate::UploadRequest`], and
//! [`crate::DownloadResponse`]. Depend on those re-exports, not on paths
//! reaching into `pb` directly.
